 Digital Time Capsule 
# project overview
    Hello! This repository is a project I completed for my Web Design course, during Aug/Sept 2023. This website serves a “Digital Time Capsule” of my life at the moment: where I’ve been, what I’m listening to, and who I am. 
# technical overview 
    Currently, I would say this site is 90% done. I’d like to add more interactive features and add to my CSS styling. The basic text and content is made with HTML (heading + paragraph styles, links, buttons, img height & width, header and footer). All of the styling is done with CSS (colors, photo placement & alignment, font styles, margin sizing, cursor, hover overlay & movement).
