 Digital Time Capsule 
MOTIVATION
    Hello! This repository is a project I completed for my Web Design course, during Aug/Sept 2023. This website serves a “Digital Time Capsule” of my life at the moment: where I’ve been, what I’m listening to, and who I am. 
BUILD STATUS 
    Currently, I would say this site is 75% done. I’d like to add more interactive features and add to my CSS styling. Ideally, I'll have full width navigation bar, 
CODE STYLE
    The best text and content is made with HTML (heading + paragraph styles, links, buttons, img height & width, header and footer). All of the styling is done with CSS (colors, photo placement & alignment, font styles, sizing & formatting). 
SCREENSHOTS
    TBD
