                       <p> Demille is a junior at San Francisco State University, majoring in Visual Communication Design. Demille was born in Oakland, CA, and raised in various parts of East Bay, mainly Hayward and San Leandro. She lived in the Central Valley for her high school years, and missed the Bay Area greatly, so she and her grandparents returned permanently, so she could attend San Francisco State. Demille loves art, fashion, design (particularly creative direction and design related to music), and Black history. Her favorite painters, designers, and fashion houses include Faith Ringgold, Ernie Barnes, Emory Douglas, Shusei Nagaoka, Guo Pei, Versace, Schiaparelli, and Mugler. </p>

                       <p> She has a deep passion for music, particularly Black music history. She loves discoverings samples, collecting vinyls, Afrofuturism, and finding Africanisms in old and modern forms of Black American music. Her favorite artists include, Beyoncé, Mariah Carey, Stevie Wonder, Luther Vandross, Bootsy Collins, DeBarge, Teena Marie, Earth, Wind & Fire, and Michael Jackson. One of her favorite things to do is curate playlists based on moods, musical keys, certain seasons, climate, or colors. She says, "For me, certain keys represent colors, others exude warmth, or sound like how a misty breeze would feel." Beside being an avid music listener, she has played piano, violin, and cello at different points during her childhood. She is currently teaching herself how to play the bass guitar. She is vinyl collector, and her collection includes, <em>Hotter Than July</em> by Stevie Wonder, <em>Renaissance</em> by Beyoncé, <em> In Square Circle </em> by Stevie Wonder, <em> All N All </em> by Earth, Wind, & Fire, <em> Hollywood Squares</em> by Bootsy Collins, <em>Sukiyaki</em> by Taste of Honey, <em> Love Takes Time</em> by Mariah Carey, and Alex Haley’s autobiographical narrative <em>Tells the Story of His Search for Roots.</em> As of now she’s still juggling her options for her long term career. At the top of the list is traditional graphic design and UX/UI design specifically for libraries. She loves creating, problem-solving, reconfiguring things to make them more accessible and user-friendly.
