                            <p> One of her favorite things to do is curate playlists based on moods, musical keys, certain seasons, climate, or colors. She says, "For me, certain keys represent colors, others exude warmth, or sound like how a misty breeze would feel." Beside being an avid music listener, she has played piano, violin, and cello at different points during her childhood. She is currently teaching herself how to play the bass guitar. She is a vinyl collector and her collection includes, <em>Hotter Than July</em> by Stevie Wonder, <em>Renaissance</em> by Beyoncé, <em> In Square Circle </em> by Stevie Wonder, <em> All N All </em> by Earth, Wind, & Fire, <em> Hollywood Squares</em> by Bootsy Collins, <em>Sukiyaki</em> by Taste of Honey, <em> Love Takes Time</em> by Mariah Carey, and Alex Haley’s autobiographical narrative <em>Tells the Story of His Search for Roots.</em> As of now she’s still juggling her options for her long term career. At the top of the list is traditional graphic design and UX/UI design specifically for libraries. She loves creating, problem-solving, reconfiguring things to make them more accessible and user-friendly.
