Beside being an avid music listener, she has played piano, violin, and cello at different points during her childhood. She is currently teaching herself how to play the bass guitar. She is vinyl collector, and her collection includes, <em>Hotter Than July</em> by Stevie Wonder, <em>Renaissance</em> by Beyoncé, <em> In Square Circle </em> by Stevie Wonder, <em> All N All </em> by Earth, Wind, & Fire, <em> Hollywood Squares</em> by Bootsy Collins, <em>Sukiyaki</em> by Taste of Honey, <em> Love Takes Time</em> by Mariah Carey, and Alex Haley’s autobiographical narrative <em>Tells the Story of His Search for Roots.</em> </p>
